# 1 Introduction
Unit testing is an important part of software development that ensures that each individual component of a program operates as expected. In this report, we outline our test strategy for testing the org.jfree.data.DataUtilities and org.jfree.data.Range classes. We implement black-box testing techniques using equivalence classes and boundary value anaylsis to design effective test cases that consider various input scenarios and edge cases.

We will also discuss the use of mocking as a strategy to test the classes. Mocking allows for the isolation of the components being tested, resultingi n a more controlled testing environment. We also consider the benefits and drawbacks of mocking, such as its ability to enhance test reliability and speed, however sometimes oversimplifying the system interactions and missing integration issues.


# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

We are testing all 5 methods of org.jfree.data.DataUtilities and we have chosen 5 other methods from org.jfree.data.Range to test as mentioned in the assignment guideline.

The testing strategy for unit testing involves testing individual components of the software in isolation. The test-case design approach is based on black-box techniques, where the internal workings of the component are not considered, and testing is done based on input and output.

Equivalence classes are used to partition the input space into classes that are expected to exhibit similar behavior. For example, the tests calculateColumnTotalWithMaxColumns, calculateColumnTotalWithThreeColumn, and calculateColumnTotalForTwoValues are seen as testing different equivalence classes of the number of columns.

Boundary value analysis is used to test the boundaries of the input space, which are often sources of errors. Tests like correctLowerBoundForPositiveRange, correctLowerBoundForNegativeRange, correctUpperBoundForPositiveRange, and correctUpperBoundForNegativeRange apply this technique.

Mocking is beneficial as it allows for the isolation of the component being tested, making the tests more reliable and faster. However, it can lead to oversimplification of the system interactions and might miss some integration issues.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We divded the work in half and adopted the peer programming method for writing test cases. Two of us worked on the test cases for the DataUtilities class, while the other worked on the Range class. We then swapped and verified each others tests by commenting and running each others code to ensure every team member understood every bit of code. 

We also used the help of ChatGPT to edit our comments to provide a clear description for the methods we wrote. Moreover, we used ChatGPT to do long menial tasks like writing out what every single test case tests for in the lab report. By providing ChatGPT with code we wrote we asked, "provide a list of what method each test case tests for and if it falls under equivalence partitioning or boundary value analysis." We also asked it to format the output in a markdown file for readability.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

When creating Mock objects, originally we foudn it difficult to understand the purpose and the syntax to create and use Mock objects. It took reading the documentation for jMock and using the test case provided in the assignment guildine to fully understand how creating Mock objects worked. We now know that Mock objects allow us as the tester to limit and specify the interactions with a Mock object allowing for more control over our test cases.

This lab allowed us to learn how to write tests in a team environment while using new technologies like Eclipse IDE and jMock. It also taught us how to effectively perform black box testing, starting off with a list of requirements (method summaries) and writing boundary and equivalence partitioned test cases.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself
The instructions to set up eclipse and create unit tests were very clear and easy to follow. This lab served as a good way to apply the skills we learned in class including test designing, black-box testing, unit testing using JUnit, and testing using mock objects.
