# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

We are testing all 5 methods of org.jfree.data.DataUtilities and we have chosen 5 other methods from org.jfree.data.Range to test as mentioned in the assignment guideline.
### org.jfree.data.DataUtilities
| Method Name           | Method Usage (return type)| What We Are Testing |
|------------------------------------------------| -------------------------- | ---------- |
| calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column)| Returns the sum of the values in one column of the supplied data table. (static double) | Correct return type and value, throws exception with invalid input |
| calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row)      | Returns the sum of the values in one row of the supplied data table. (static double) | Correct return type and value, throws exception with invalid input |
| createNumberArray(double[] data)               | Constructs an array of Number objects from an array of double primitives. (static java.lang.Number[]) | Correct return type and value, throws exception with invalid input |
| createNumberArray2D(double[][] data)           | Constructs an array of arrays of Number objects from a corresponding structure containing double primitives. (static java.lang.Number[][]) | Correct return type and value, throws exception with invalid input |
| getCumulativePercentages(KeyedValues data)     |  Returns a KeyedValues instance that contains the cumulative percentage values for the data in another KeyedValues instance. (static KeyedValues) | Correct return type and value, throws exception with invalid input |

# 3 Test cases developed

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above
